   	<h1> Indonesia - Bali </h1>
   	<p> Indonesia has literally 17.000 islands and it is known as the largest Muslim country in the world. But Bali, holds a large community of Hindu people (+80% of the population) which makes this Island home of Indonesia's Hindu minority.  
   	</p>

   	<p>
   		The first time you go to Bali Island you kind of have a feeling of 'Is that all that is?' But after a first impression, Bali starts to enter into you and then you realize that probably this is one of the most amazing places in Asia. Whether is the nice and gentle people of Bali, the fancy hotels, Beach Clubs and restaurants, or even the original and unique clothing outlets, all together they create a remarkable atmosphere that will keep calling you to return. And definitely you will fell nostalgic once you leave and wanting to go back to this distinctive Indonesian Island!
   	</p>
   	
   	<p>
		Bali is quite known for its waves which are perfect to practice surf. The best beaches are in the Southern part of the Island and mainly in the South peninsula. Surfers love beaches such as Uluwatu, Suluban, Padang Padang, among other perfect spots for surfing. But if you just want to relax and have your deserved sunbath and diving, you have lots of great beaches: Seminyak, Sanur, Nusa Dua, Canggu. Or why not just relax by the swimming pool in Ubud, the spot where the movie 'Eat, Pray and Love' was shot? Ubud is also a perfect spot for a bicycle or scoter ride along the unforgettable rice fields. You have plenty of stalls across Bali renting both bicycles and scooters.

  <p>
  	If you plan to visit some temples please do so early in the morning or in the evening as during the day is almost impossible to bear the hot weather and high humidity. The most beautiful is the Uluwatu temple but beware of the monkeys! They are basically everywhere, observing you all the time and waiting for any distraction to steal your mobile phone, hat or sun glass. This temple stands on a beautiful cliff and you can take incredible pictures from there or even climb the stairs until the highest part of the shrine.

<p>
	The Tanah Lot Temple is also a remarkable one. Standing on rock and only reachable by land during the low tide. 
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to go to Ubud and stay there for a few days you should visit the Monkey Forest and its temples. It is a quite unique experience as probably you will never see such a number of monkeys in your whole life. But again, be careful and do not carry objects on your hand or look the monkeys in their eyes. They can be quite fierce animals when they are all together in a community. 
</p>
<p>
	And then Bali it is also about going to fancy restaurants, bars, Beach Clubs and shopping at trendy clothing outlets. You will find a concentration of the best spots at Seminyak. But be aware because this village is now starting to be seriously crowded, especially during high season. It you are more fancy on quiet places then you should choose other villages such as Sanur, Canggu or Nusa-Dua.

  </div>

  <p>
  	The most famous Beach Clubs in Seminyak that you should not miss are the Potato Head (https://www.ptthead.com/) and the Ku-De-Ta (https://www.kudeta.com/). Both have swimming pools and beds that you can rent for the day while drinking the best cocktails in Bali and tasting amazing food. Ku-de-Ta is also well-known for its music and CD collections (https://www.discogs.com/Various-Ku-De-Ta-Volume-1-Best-Of/release/6521374). The best DJs in the world want for sure perform at KDT. 
  </p>

<p>
	Another thing you should definitely experience is to have a Balinese massage. Before booking your hotel make sure it has a SPA or just ask where the best SPA nearby is. There are plenty of SPAs in Bali offering all sorts of treatments. Take some time to enjoy and indulge at a SPA, it is an experience you will never forget.

<h2> Tips: </h2>

<ul>

<p>
	Visa: You have visa on arrival but please check if you have to pay for the visa as in 2016 the rules have changed for a number of countries which luckily are now exempted to pay for it. 
</p>

<p> 
	Currency: the official currency is the Indonesian rupiah and you will find lots of places where to exchange money or ATMs to withdraw local money. 
</p>

<p>
	Best time of the year to visit: You can visit Bali practically during the whole year but the best time is the dry season, between April and May or from July to October. 
</p>

<p>
	Number of days: If you are coming from afar it is recommendable to stay at least one week or combine a visit to Bali with a trip to Lombok or to the Gili Islands. Or you can chose to stay some nights in Seminyak to experience a more exciting atmosphere and then move a few nights to Ubud to a SPA retreat. If you live in Asia you can afford to travel to Bali for a long weekend and repeat the program as much times as you can. Air Asia has quite affordable direct flights to Bali almost from all the capitals in Asia. 
</p>

<p>
	Recommended Hotels: The Oberoi in Seminyak (http://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-bali/) is one of the pearls of Bali as it is not the latest novelty but still a luxury 5 stars hotel you can afford for a long weekend. A cheaper option and with a great location is the Ize Hotel (http://www.ize-seminyak.com/). Ize Hotel is located near the most lively part of Seminyak. In Ubud try the Komaneka at Monkey Forest, which is very well located or any of the Komaneka hotels (http://www.komaneka.com/).
</p>

<p>
	Recommended Restaurants: In Seminyak try both 'Ku-de-Ta' and 'Potato Head' Beach Clubs to lunch or dine. An affordable and fancy one is 'Cafe Bali' but you have to book in advance. Both 'Metis' or 'Sarong' are also good options if you want to try exquisite cuisine and afford to pay for it. And please do not miss the 'Sardine', it has an amazing food and atmosphere. In Ubud try 'The Three Monkeys'.
